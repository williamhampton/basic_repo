how I created my repository:
create repository on github following directions
then from the command line:
git clone https://github.com/williamhampton/basic_repo.git
git touch (file name)
git touch (another file name)
git add . (or git add filename)
git commit -m "this is the comment you make"
git push
and we are done!!!
